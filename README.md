# MediaCenter-Delphi-VCL
Windows MediaCenter VCL control with animations using Direct2D

I want to create a application for my home control (Philips Hue lighting, multiroom audio, etc etc) and because i like the Vista/Win7|8 MediaCenter, i wanted to create a control that looks like and behaves like Windows Media Center.
Now this component is far from done, and i will update it when i have the time.. But it might be fun to some other people too, so do as you like..

It uses the PNG's from MediaCenter, you will need to extract these yourself from ehres.dll
